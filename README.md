# Numerical-Scientific-Computing-mandelbrot-mini-project
This repository includes code for a mini-project in the Course Numerical Scientific Computing at Aalborg University during spring 2021.
The mini-project deals with implementing algorithms in Python for approximating the Mandelbrot set and mapping each point in complex space to a 2D image illustration of the Mandelbrot set.

## Repository structure
The repository is structured with 

## How to use runfile
To generate data ```python mandelbrot_runfile.py``` is used. 

## How to generate plots
To generate plots the ```plot_from_file.py``` is used. 
In order to run this file the two data files ```alldata``` and ```mandelbrot_data``` must be in the root folder. 
```python mandelbrot_data``` can be found in a ```.zip``` file in the ```Data``` folder.
