# Numerical-Scientific-Computing-mandelbrot-mini-project
This repository includes code for a mini-project in the Course Numerical Scientific Computing at Aalborg University during spring 2021.
The mini-project deals with implementing algorithms in Python for approximating the Mandelbrot set and mapping each point in complex space to a 2D image illustration of the Mandelbrot set.
